    content: "Budgets are tightening, customers are churning, and itâ€™s getting increasingly harder to close new business.
    <br />
    <br />
    Buyers are overwhelmed and constantly targeted through direct outbound and inbound channels, creating a sea of spam and generic communications, making it increasingly harder for products to stand out.
    <br />
    <br /> 
    Modern founders are facing modern problems:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "An average B2B company sends <u>306 cold emails</u> to get 1 lead."
      - "Gmail and other email providers have reduced the spam report threshold to 0.3%, risking the compromise of your domain's sending capability"
      - "LinkedIn limits you to <u>100-200 messages per week</u>."
      - "Competition is tougher than ever. Software production costs have dropped every year, making it hard to find product differentiation."
    conclusion: "Mass AI outbound is not going to solve your problems. Fancier email subject lines are not going to get you to cut through the noise.
    <br />
    <br /> 
    As a result, B2B buyers turn to trusted relationships to buy their products and services.
